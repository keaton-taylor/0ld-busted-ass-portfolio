        <p class="mb-0">Hi! I'm Keaton.</br>I’m a Product Designer building people-centered software and platforms. Sometimes that’s an editorial platform like <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com">Apartment Therapy</a> or <a href="https://www.mealthy.com">Mealthy</a>. Other times it’s been fundraising products like <a href="{{ site_url }}2017/09/06/raisemore.html">RaiseMore</a>. Everything I work on - at it's core - is about people. Here's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/offbw1zj8unucih/kt-resume-17.pdf?dl=0">my CV</a>, just in case you're curious.</p> 

        <h2 class="mt-0">I believe that design is about human relationships.</h2>
        <h2>I believe data and iteration are the best paths to success.</h2>
        <h2>I believe in the inherent link between design and business.</h2>
        <h2>I believe solving people problems solves business problems.</h2>
