        <p class="AboutPage__summary-two">I started out making terrible posters and album art for even worse bands. In 2011 I got a job working at a local web design studio and fell in love with the work. From there I worked for studios, startups and media companies crafting products and experiences that people love.</p>

        <p class="AboutPage__summary-three">In 2019 I was a part of a mass layoff from Treehouse four months into my tenure there. That threw my family into a tailspin that sent me to Denver, Raliegh, and San Francisco several times. We packed up our house, put it on the market, and headed for Eastern Kentucky. In that time I've been able to reevaluate my career goals, accept an offer from a really cool startup, and spend a lot of time with my family.</p>
