        <p class="PersonalComponent__content pn_text">I’m a Product Designer building people-centered software and platforms. Sometimes that’s an editorial platform like <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com">Apartment Therapy</a> or <a href="https://www.mealthy.com">Mealthy</a>. Other times it’s been fundraising products like <a href="{{ site_url }}2017/09/06/raisemore.html">RaiseMore</a>. Everything I work on - at it's core - is about people. Here's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/offbw1zj8unucih/kt-resume-17.pdf?dl=0">my CV</a>, just in case you're curious. Also fair warning: this is where I try new things, so strap in, it's gonna get weird.</p>

I didnt always value the same things or do the same kind of work but I've always loved the act of creating. Here are a few samples of things I've worked on over the years. Thanks for looking.</p>
