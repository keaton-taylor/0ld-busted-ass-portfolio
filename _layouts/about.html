          <h2>What I do</h2>
          <p>I help motivated people build exceptional mobile and web-based digital products. Right now that mean I spend my days helping the great people at <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com">Apartment Therapy Media</a> build a world-class lifestyle editorial product.</p>
          <p>In the past I've helped companies achieve ther goals through user-centered design and standards based front end development.</p>
          <p>When I'm not building the internet I'm being wrestled to the ground by two preschool boys and a kindergartener girl while my wife looks on and laughs.</p>
          <p>I also love craft beer, acidic coffee and bad tv. If any or all of that sounds like fun let's make some stuff together.</p>
