        <p class="mt-0">Hi, like I said, my name is Keaton Taylor. I'm a designer focusing on building digital products. I'm also a husband and a dad. In reality, it's like Husband, Dad and then like 30 other things and then I'm a designer. I like fishing, craft beer, and the Houston Rockets.</p>

      <p class="AboutPage__summary-two">I got really excited about design through making posters and stuff for my cousin's hardcore <a href="https://myspace.com/killthatkidmusic/music/songs">band.</a> I ended up going to the local university for graphic design and printmaking. While I was in college a good <a href="http://mattspiel.com/">friend</a> of mine gave me an opportunity to come work with him at the small web design company he had been designing for a while. We designed a bunch of websites for a bunch of different things and poof, I was in love with web design.</p>

      <p class="AboutPage__summary-three">After bouncing around and doing contract work for 5 years I landed at Apartment Therapy Media to focus on building digital products full time. I take on contract product work from time to time and really enjoy talking to people in general. If you have any questions or comments, hit me up on twitter or through <a href="mailto:keatontaylor@me.com?Subject=Hello%20Friend">email.</a></p>

              <p>People First</p>
              <p class="m-0">Nothing survives if people aren't at the forefront of what you're making. Solving real problems for real people creates a firm foundation.</p>

              <p>Data Informed</p>
              <p class="m-0">Qualitative data fleshes out the narrative that quantitative data sets. Don't guess. Talk to people, then watch what they do.</p>

            <div class="AboutPage__values-item">
              <p>Do the Job</p>

              <p>Tiny Wins</p>
              <p class="m-0">Sometimes 10x isn't realistic. Let's strive for iteration and tiny wins until we hit the jackpot.</p>
