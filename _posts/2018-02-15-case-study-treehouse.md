### A Brief Introduction
Treehouse is a mission driven ed-tech company focused on making tech education an affordable, life-changing opportunity. As a company, Treehouse has an incredibly successful product with an incredible team of educators, engineers, designers and success representatives. During my time at Treehouse I was lucky enough to work on the Techdegree (TD) squad. Our squad was a cross-functional team focused on student-focused acquisition and conversion for our Techdegree program.

### What Problems Were We Solving?

For Q2 we wanted to iterate on existing features that would redefine the platform. Prior to kicking off Q2, our incredible data engineers were able to pinpoint some general behaviors that were common among students who have successfully converted from trial user to TD student. This, along with qualitative data gathered by teachers, PMs and Success reps would become the basis for much of our work.

### Beginning with Data
Kickoff meetings always include folks from every part of Treehouse. After sharing qual and quant data points we were able to make some connections and correlations between the "what" and the "why." We established a hypothesis that stated, "Trial users are more likely to convert to students when they have amplified access to human support." With this in mind we decided to break out and do some solo work on possible ideas. We all returned with some really amazing actionable ideas and our team members really went all out. We were shown everything from storyboards and sketches to html mocks and written narratives.

We decided on a few that really stood out as both actionable _and_ testable.

### The Work

  <p>The bulk of the work happening in Q2 is really focused in on the right side of the screen - the dashboard area. When we started the project the Dashboard Activity Panel had an activity tracking area, a mentorship scheduling link and a call to action to either join or launch the Slack group associated with the user's Techdegree program. fluctuation in team size and priorities saw the mentorship meetings end internally but it remained a glaring piece of experience debt.</p>

To try and kill 2 birds with one stone. We decided that the most obvious placement for events was in the dashboard UI. This was both because of visibility and discoverability. With a massive amount of help from engineering partners we sorted out deep-links and
