### Role & Collaboration
Through analytics and conversation, it came to our attention that the below post area on ApartmentTherapy.com was missing ad-related goals and offering a sub-optimal reading experience to our users. We used A/B testing of content recommendation APIs (Existing Parse.ly API and a new API from LiftIgniter), learnings from some really clear failures, and iterative design & development to solve engagement challenges.

### Project Summary
During my time at Treehouse I was lucky enough to work on the Techdegree (TD) squad. Our squad was a cross-functional team focused on student-focused acquisition and conversion for our TD program. Working with our Student Success reps and research engineers we found common actions in what we referred to as "bright spot" students. The most common triggers both revolved around community engagement and human interaction. With this information in hand we aimed to increase adoption and use frequency of our TD community groups in Slack. Our hypothesis was built around the idea that if we could get our potential students engaged with other students and success reps in their first hour of using the platform, they would flourish. Current students would have access to these updates as well, hopefully increasing value and engagement across all students - trial or full-time.

**My Role**  
This was my first major project at Treehouse, so I was paired with the lead product designer to make sure I had my own support system within my squad. I worked closely with the PM and engineering director to define and frame problems within the scope of initiatives in Q2. My role within the greater team was as a co-facilitator during our early idea sharing sessions and then UI/UX Design and doing sone light front end dev work on the feature(s) we decided to execute on.

### Challenge
Building features that are useful across the user-base is a first-tier goal at Treehouse. With this project the challenge really centered around how to make something as banal as using Slack feel human and personal. Working remotely for the last six years, I can attest to the challenges inherent to working away from the rest of a team. In an educational situation it's even more pressing. You have to complete specific units and assignments in a timely manner or the money you are paying for the education becomes less valuable. As a platform we have to deliver that value even when time is a strain.

### Research & Planning
Everything, for me, starts with people. In planning for Q2 we asked the question, "what makes a successful student successful?" Internally, these students are often referred to as _Bright Spot Students_. We worked with teachers, student success reps and research engineers to pinpoint qualitative and quantitative actions Bright Spot students performed on their path to success. We found that students who were most engaged with community as a support system both in and outside of their TD cohort, tended to be more successful. This peaked the interest of our cross functional team.

Using this idea - that having a support system in place was one of the defining attributes of that bright spot student - as a north star, I started assessing our student's in-app lifecycle. Our TD students lived in three main areas of the product - the Dashboard, the learning/assessment views and Workspaces. Workspaces are definitely not in the scope of the current project. For this phase of Q2 we decided to focus on the dashboard. Specifically, we asked the question, "how can we bring the community and human aspect of our slack communities into the app?"

# Hypothesis: Increasing visibility and access to Techdegree-specific communities will increase trial conversions.

### Process
collecting data and making decisions

Based on the feedback from our qualitative testing and feedback after presenting testing results to our stakeholders we all came out of a regroup meeting with one plan - simplify and ship something.

Tests
