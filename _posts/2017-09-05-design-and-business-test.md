For a while now, I’ve been saying some form of “Design & Business are inherently linked.” Recently I've been having second-thoughts. Aren't Design & People the actual link? The business aspect feels like a co-opting of design's positive affect on people. I don't want to say that business has hijacked design to make it about profit but that's kind of what I'm saying.

So to that end design and business _are linked_ - it's just is kind of a shitty link. I think this reenforces how Jared Spool defines design: It's the rendering of intent. There's no morality or implied integrity tied to rendering an intent. It just IS. I guess the responsibility always comes back to the renderer.

As I go about my work this week I'm going to try and closely consider my intent. I'll make a note somewhere on what the intent was behind the thing I'm working on. I'd like to consider many intents and think through their potential results.
