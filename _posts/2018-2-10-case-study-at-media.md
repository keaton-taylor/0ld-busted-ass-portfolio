### In 2016 I transitioned from 4 years of working as a web and graphic designer to working on digital products full-time and on purpose. After interviewing with a few companies I landed at Apartment Therapy. The team, the culture and the focus on quality outcomes drew me in and have kept me going for just over 2 years.

### The Condensed Version
Here are a few exciting projects and features I've worked on at Apartment Therapy. I'll have more information and images up soon.

#### Color Search
My first project at AT Media was a complete overhaul of our Sherwin-Williams sponsored Color Search tool. I came into the process as wireframes were being handed off and was able to jump in and contribute to the team in the first 2 weeks after I started. Our work did not go unnoticed - along with our sales team, our work on Color Search won an IAB Mixx award in 2016.

#### Building an A/B Testing Framework
Because of my love for data-informed design I was tapped to work with our Lead Front End Engineer to build a new system into our - largely monolithic - codebase. Using a fancy Varnish setup, courtesy of our Back End team, we created an internal methodology to use feature flippers and traffic splitting via our CDN. We were able to test this out of the box on social sharing designs for images. Our tests Eventually produced a 20% increase m/m in social sharing to Pinterest.

#### AT Media Redesign
I worked alongside our entire team to redesign and refactor our web products to be more component-based and performance aware. This included writing tons and tons of CSS (Sass) and learning a lot about Ruby on Rails and React.js on the fly.

#### Community Focused initiatives
My all-time favorite projects for AT Media have been the online community driven initiatives. Launching our new Save feature, refreshing our profile pages and ongoing projects to integrate more connective community features have been a joy to work on. We have a dedicated user0base that loves to connect through comments and social media. It's been a real treat developing features to satisfy some long-standing requests and work with users to develop a roadmap of new and upcoming features.

#### Working Closely with Sales and Art on Revenue-Focused Features
I literally can not count how many sponsored or revenue-centered pages I've designed and developed on the AT Media sites. Establishing focus, business goals and partner needs with our incredible creative services and sales teams to launch collections and custom pages for organizations like NAR, Land O' Lakes, Miracle-Gro and Frigidaire.
