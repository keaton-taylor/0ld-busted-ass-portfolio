  <h3>My Role</h3>
  During my time at Treehouse I was lucky enough to work on the Techdegree (TD) squad. Our squad was a cross-functional team focused on acquisition and conversion for our TD program.  This was my first major project at Treehouse, so I was paired with the lead product designer to make sure I had my own support system within my squad. I worked very closely with my PM (When I refer to myself as 'we' I almost certainly mean mean my PM and me) and engineering director to define and frame problems within the scope of initiatives in Q2. My role within the greater team was as a co-facilitator during our early idea sharing sessions and then UI/UX Design and doing some light front end dev work on the feature(s) we decided to execute on.

  <h3>The Problem Space</h3>
  The underlying problems we were looking to solve for Q2 on the TD squad were both business and human related. On the business side we wanted to increase the trial to paid conversion for folks trying out our TD program. This was a relatively new product but data on the trend of conversions for our programs were pointing to a season where experimenting with and optimizing the existing experience was a necessary task to take on. On the human side, our calls to action for our Slack community were thin and often were lost in the UI that currently existed. Through exit interviews that teachers carried out we learned that there was a feeling that support needs were not being met. From Teachers, there was a feeling like students weren't taking advantage of the resources that were being offered. For example, weekly office hours were being held for each of the TD disciplines but attendance was usually 3-5 students out of a class of nearly 20.

  <h3>Challenges & Constraints</h3>
  <p>Building features that are useful across the user-base is a first-tier goal at Treehouse. With this project the challenge really centered around how to make something as banal as using Slack feel human and personal. Working remotely for the last several years, I can attest to the challenges inherent to working away from the rest of a team. In an educational situation it's even more pressing. You have to complete specific units and assignments in a timely manner or the money you are paying for the education becomes less valuable. As a platform we have to deliver that value even when students are not in an optimal brain space.</p>

  <p>Some other challenges we identified were:
  <ul>
  <li>Students who were not well-versed in tech might not <em>want</em> to use slack.</li>
  <li>Frankly, new people are scary.</li>
  <li>Asking questions can be scary.</li>
  <li>What if no one is available?</li>
  </ul>
  These were all real concerns we kept in mind during these processes. It became a sort of tenet of this work to "Minimize anxiety," as best we could.</p>

  <h3>Research & Planning</h3>
    <section class="container__split">
    <div>
      Everything, for me, starts with people. Working with our Student Success reps, teachers, and research engineers we found common qualitative and quantitative actions in what we referred to as <em>Bright Spot Students</em>. On their path to success, these <em>Bright Spot Students</em> were found to have engaged with our Slack groups early and often. Engaging in conversation, creating camaraderie and asking questions related to coursework were their norm. We found that students who were most engaged with community as a support system both in and outside of their TD cohort, tended to be more successful.

      <p>Digging more into some of the qualitative data that teachers had been collecting through exit interviews and correlating it with quantitative data inside our products we found that many of our students who were not successful were lacking a few of the key Bright Spot Student traits. These students were often completing just as many lessons in the product, but lacked that community and support that has shown to correlate with success.</p>

  <h3>The Work</h3>
  <p>Using a support system as one of the defining attributes of that <em>Bright Spot Student</em> as a north star, I started assessing our student's in-app lifecycle. Our TD students lived in three main areas of the product - the Dashboard, the learning/assessment views and Workspaces (Workspaces held a lot of legacy code and were not in the scope of the current project). Each of these spaces has a specific set of actions that it prioritizes.<p>

</section>

<section class="container__small">
  <p>The Dashboard provides guidance on the student's progress, success and next steps. The learning and assessment views prioritize limited interaction from the student (except during assessment) and clear out a lot of extraneous UI. We started this project by working through a lot of rough ideas. I was able to work closely with my PM to quickly mock these early ideas up and get feedback on from internal stakeholders. These earlier ideas were focused on deep linking users into slack from potential problem areas (learning and assessment views) and the ability to retarget a student to a new TD program if their current one was not right for them.</p>

<section class="container__small">
  <p>It was at this point that we circled back to the idea around the Office Hours being offered to students. We checked with our Student Success team and found that more often than not, our <em>Bright Spot Students</em> were active participants in this program. Taking it upon themselves to field the emailed list of weekly dates and times and attending the Slack/Zoom meetings.<p>

  <p>This was interesting for 2 reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> If we could automate or semi-automate this process for Success Reps it would lift some burden off them and free them up to engage with students  more.</li>
    <li> If we could get students involved with Office Hours sooner in their journey, we might see a drop in churn after the trial, creating an increase in trial to paid conversions.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Knowing now that students reported a feeling of lacking support and teachers felt like some of their most useful attempts at offering support were falling on deaf ears was a huge help. Students and teachers were reporting 2 sides of the same problem! We started working with student success and sorting out how we might better serve both students and Success reps.</p>

<section class="container__small">
  <p>When we started working on this project a few things became clear about the dashboard:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Mentorship program called out in the dashboard was no longer happening.</li>
    <li>The Slack call to action (CTA) was very thin.</li>
    <li>There was no internal messaging about events or support.</li>
  </ul>

  We removed the mentoring section and cleaned up the Slack CTA a bit as a first iteration. That was a big win - removing experience debt and giving students a clear call to action was helpful. We knew there was more we could do. Our next iteration was focused on bringing those office hours into the app for visibility and clarity. We worked with our Success team to get office hours schedules ahead of time and in addition to their regular email we hardcoded the Office Hours schedule into the app. This was a trade-off we made to lessen the impact on success reps while we tested this feature over the next several weeks.

<section class="container__small">
  We started testing beta prototypes straight away. Teachers were using this version of the dashboard in upcoming exit interviews to ask some questions about how we could better serve students. Through those exit interviews we found that 4 of 5 students were either unaware or routinely forgot about office hours and cited this UI as helpful - big win. There was still work to be done to improve this feature before we shipped it though.

<section class="container__small">
  Updating the layout of the office hours schedule to feel more like an event was the first order of business. A common layout with necessary information so it stands out as easy to read and understand. The next piece was creating a more helpful call to action for Slack. We felt like outlining the real-world benefits of using slack for the TD program was crucial.

<section class="container__small">
  <p>We again put this new UI in front of students and stakeholders and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Building a simple backend for the office hours UI was going to streamline the processes the Student Success team went through as we could send out an automated email after them update the dates and times every week. Students would be able to see when office hours and eventually other events were taking place. There was a lot to be excited about here. One piece of feedback kept nagging at me though.</p>

  <h2 class="mb-2">"It feels connected and it feels informational but I still don't know who to talk to."</h2>
</section>

<section class="container__small">
<p>It was impersonal. Even if a student got past the initial barriers, there was still a lack of familiarity and human interaction. Its hard to adequately attain human connection in a product. One of the ways that we can do that though, is with faces. Avatars create a mixed-reality world where you can connect with someone using their avatar as a sense of familiarity. It's jarring when someone changes their avatar because you have an expectation of what that looks like. We wanted to find ways to use this to our advantage in the dashboard. This went through several iterations.</p>

<p>In a Techdegree program our TD-specific Student success reps are the first points of contact for students. Those reps were most likely to be holding office hours and fielding technical questions in Slack. Since we already had these points of contact, it was a no-brainer to use those people as a student-facing lifeline in the dashboard. Most TD's had one lead success rep and that person was added to the dashboard in a new section called, "Your Techdegree Support Center." This acted as a call to action to join the community in slack, a way to give visibility to the main point of contact and a link out to a document outlining more support information. </p>

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>After doing the front-end work for this project I had the opportunity to pass it off to a teacher who was again reaching out to some students for feedback. In that conversation there were 2 of 5 students inn that pool who said they were likely to return to a TD program over another competing service with the addition of this feature. According to a source after I had left Treehouse, the Office Hours attendance had gone up ~25% since the feature was launched. BEfore joining Treehouse I was a student and a big fan of the organization in general. I'm very proud of the work I got to do in the short time I was there.</p>
