## RaiseMore Beta
In September of 2015, I was part of a two day user feedback summit in Oklahoma City with the entire RaiseMore team. We went through 4 feedback sessions. The rounds of one-on-one interaction with users was incredibly helpful. The Group discussions On Day 3 discussing the product roadmap was very insightful. The weekend would inform the next 3 months of product features and iteration.

Here are a Few Takeaways*:

- ~80% of our users would be using Windows computers. Up to 30% of those might use touchscreen technology in some capacity.

  <small>_Our collective use of Apple hardware caused us to miss some glaring usability issues. We missed hover states, color inconsistencies and responsive issues on smaller screens. We missed these things because we were seeing the product through our tech focused lens._</small>


- Visual design inside the dashboard caused a lot of confusion. Defaulting to ghost buttons and a flat UI pattern was often and easily missed by our testers.

  <small>_Our internal bias toward aesthetics vs. experience was exposed. This surfaced some internal frustration on our team between UX and Visual design imperatives. The dialogue we had here was tense but positive. If people can't accomplish the product tasks, we will have a hard time making them customers._</small>


- The things we thought were going to be super important were a lot less important. One of our assumptions was that the user would start in the app at the feed page. This would allow the user to see the status and relevant data points of all their teammates. During testing, our groups let us know they would opt for a view based on the health of their event(s) instead.

  <small>_An interesting pattern emerged here. The money raised is important but not on such a granular level. The overall event health was a more desirable metric. From there our partners could dig deeper and address individual coaching needs. There was a very "leader-leader" structure to the way our partners managed events._</small>

If it seems like some of this was inordinately surprising - it's because it genuinely was. For most of this team there was a feeling that we really had our finger on the pulse of the industry. As it turned out many on our team were shocked.
