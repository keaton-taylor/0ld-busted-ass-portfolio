## In-App Coaching

During the course of my time at RaiseMore there was one feature I coveted more than any other. I loved the possibilities around in-app coaching and messaging. I loved the idea of our team leaders being able to insert content into someone's feed to encourage them or coach them. Our original idea was just that this would come in the form of a push notification. Push notifications turned out to be a technical limitation. As an alternative we looked into adding both automated messages and what it might look like to allow an admin to send messages from the admin dashboard.

Our first step was to define some types of messages that might be sent. Warning Alerts, Coaching, Reminders, Data Points. The possibilities of message types are nearly endless. We went through a few different types of message and thought about how it might look and feel. starting with the icons it might use.

There was an initial idea that floated around of using photos uploaded to the app as posts to help give a personalized feel to the notifications.

The implementation was more challenging than we were ready to take on at such an early stage. We opted to work with the icons and an integrated color-field that might be slightly different depending on the colors chosen in the app building process.
