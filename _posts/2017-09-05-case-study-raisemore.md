## Summary
In the Summer of 2015 I joined a friend at a startup he had been  working at as lead front end engineer. He asked me to join RaiseMore as a long term contractor to sort out some Product and Experience issues.  RaiseMore was a social fundraising platform. We used teamwork and social interactions to maximize fundraising efforts. In turn we used the aggregate data to help predict fundraising trends and success patterns. RaiseMore included a marketing website, a dashboard and a mobile app builder. I had the pleasure of taking part in some  exciting experiences during my time with RaiseMore. RaiseMore stands out in my memory as a great team and some really great work.
