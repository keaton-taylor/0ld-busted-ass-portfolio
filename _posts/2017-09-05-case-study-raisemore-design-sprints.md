## Design Sprints
As a distributed team, traditional Design Sprints presented a specific set of challenges. We had to make some changes to the process to fit our needs. None of us had much, if any, experience with Design Sprints. We had read a few blogs on the GV site and were essentially diving in and hoping for the best. The process we identified  for ourselves was this:

  - Define requirements
  - Group Sketch exercise and critique
  - Regroup and update requirements as needed
  - Sketch exercise and critique
  - Prototype feature for testing
  - Project handoff for final design/engineering

We did this over the course of around a week. Definitely not the ideal system (Sorry Jake and Daniel). What this exposed inside our team though was that we didnâ€™t have a good process for iteration. We were burning through tasks as a pretty high rate. The side effect of that speed was that issues were being exposed and backlogged, never to be seen again.
