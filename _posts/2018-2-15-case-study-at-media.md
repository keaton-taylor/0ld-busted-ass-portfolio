### In 2016 I transitioned from 4 years of working as a web and graphic designer to working on digital products full-time and on purpose. After interviewing with a few companies I landed at Apartment Therapy. The team, the culture and the focus on quality outcomes drew me in and have kept me going for just over 2 years.

### The Condensed Version
I've gotten to work on a great many fun and interesting projects at Apartment Therapy. I'd like to quickly highlight a few that I felt were exceptionally fun and/or challenging.

### Color Search by Sherwin-Williams
My first project at AT Media was a complete overhaul of our Sherwin-Williams sponsored Color Search tool, which was a collaboration with McKinney. I came into the process as wireframes were being handed off and was able to jump in and contribute to the team in the first 2 weeks after I started. Our work did not go unnoticed - along with our partners at McKinney and our dorect sales team, our work on Color Search won an IAB Mixx award in 2016.

### Helping Build an A/B Testing Framework and Using it
Because of my love for data-informed design I was tapped to work with our Lead Front End Engineer to build a new system into our - largely monolithic - codebase. Using a fancy Varnish setup, courtesy of our Back End team, we created an internal methodology to use feature flippers and traffic splitting via our CDN. We were able to test this out of the box on social sharing designs for images. Our tests Eventually produced a 20% increase m/m in social sharing to Pinterest.

### Home Page Teaser Redesign
At the end of 2017 our team wanted to be more experimental and take more risks with how we were showing content. A piece of low-hanging but effective piece of fruit related directly to this was our home page teasers. Those little image and text sandwiches that give our readers hints about what they're looking at and for. We say a 35%+ increase in clicks on teasers on the home page by updating our layout to be more scroll-friendly. I worked with our Lead PM and my Design Manager to work through a couple of iterations of a horizontal teaser. Using our A/B testing framework and Google Optimize, we tested a couple of treatments. What we landed on was simple and scrollable and was a great win in user engagement metrics.

### Community Focused initiatives
My all-time favorite projects for AT Media have been the online community driven initiatives. Launching our new Save feature, refreshing our profile pages and ongoing projects to integrate more connective community features have been a joy to work on. We have a dedicated user0base that loves to connect through comments and social media. It's been a real treat developing features to satisfy some long-standing requests and work with users to develop a roadmap of new and upcoming features.
