I get having a personal brand and being totally unaffected by life and general challenges. I was that way in my early 20's. Maybe it's kids, maybe it's God or maybe it's just being in my 30's. I just can't handle that anymore. I want to be affected by the world around me. I want to feel something other than frustration or, even worse, superiority.

Instead of acting unaffected and too cool for school, why don't we just accept that we're all people and life is hard and together it's infinitely better?

Just... Probably just be nice to people?
