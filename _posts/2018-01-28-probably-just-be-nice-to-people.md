I get having a personal brand and being like... totally unaffected by life and stuff. I was that way in my early 20's. Maybe it's kids, maybe it's God or maybe it's just being in my 30's. I just can't handle that anymore.

Instead of acting unaffected and too cool for school, why don't we just accept that we're all people and life is hard and together it's infinitely better?

I dunno. Probably listening to too much Bren√© Brown.

Just... Probably just be nice to people?
