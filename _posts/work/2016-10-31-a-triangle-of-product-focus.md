excerpt: When you have two or more distinct user roles to serve inside a growing company, how do you define who the most right stakeholder is? Welp, as with most things, in most cases, that just depends.

_I'm woefully under-informed in this subject but I'm going to share some thoughts on ad sales for editorial products. also I work with an ad-ops team that kicks ass and we don't have this issue (to my knowledge)._

I used to be a salesperson. I was in management at two different retail stores and one of the things I hated about it was the idea that I had people working for me on commission. Commission is a really interesting idea in sales - sell more and we'll pay you more. It always felt kind of dirty because it pushes employees to sell more and bigger rather than better. 

In working for a company that does in fact sell advertising packages, it strikes me as even more of a conflict. If a product company is paying sales people on commission there is an innate possibility that the person selling will put her sales numbers before the product. Making damn sure an ad loads/performs becomes more important than the (internal and external) users of the product. There has to be a confluence of organizational priority that puts Users first but doesn't ignore clients. 

![Triangle of Focus](/assets/images/triangle_of_focus.png)

Where's the sweet spot in this triangle? 
• Too far up and to the right and you lose focus on the people who control your revenue. 
• Too far up and to the left you alienate content creators and clients. 
• Too far down and you're showing people they don't matter

The problem inherent in product teams and companies is that even if we're right in the dead-center every single time we're probably alienating someone in those stakeholder corners. It might just be that we need more ad impressions so we'll add an extra DFP call to the bottom of a post. Maybe the editorial staff has a hard time posting this new type of content we're created for users but we don't have sprints to spend on infrastructure. It's a brutal cycle. 

I guess this is where product thinking comes in. What is the best option to maximize experience, efficiency and revenue? We're not looking for something at dead center. We're looking for something center enough to make more and better sense than the far flung alternatives.
