# Raise More
Summer of 2015 I joined a friend at his new startup, RaiseMore as a long term contractor to sort out some UI/UX issues. RaiseMore helped non-profits raise more money through better data collection and engaged participants. RaiseMore includes a website, a web based dashboard and mobile apps built on Ionic. I went into it with a great amount of excitement. 

I had the pleasure of taking part in some exciting exercises from user tests to leading remote design Sprints.

## RaiseMore Beta

September 15-16 of 2016, I was part of a 2 day user feedback summit in Oklahoma City with the entire RaiseMore team. We went through 4 sessions of feedback on 3 aspects of the product and our product roadmap. 

### Here are a few takeaways*:

~80% of our users would be using Windows computers. Up to 30% of those might be touchscreen Windows laptops and workstations.
Our collective use of Apple hardware caused us to miss some glaring usability issues. We missed hover states, color inconsistencies and responsive issues on smaller screens. We missed these things because we were seeing the product through our tech focused lens. 

Our calls to action inside the dashboard were not very clear, especially on the status page. 
The Status Page is the first page a user lands on in the Dashboard. To confirm they are using the product, the user has to go through a few steps. We did not think those through as calls to action in the first iteration of the product. 

The things we thought were going to be super important are a lot less important. 
One of our assumptions was that users would start in the app from the feed page. This would allow the user to see the status of all their teammates. During testing, our groups let us know they would opt for a view based on the health of their event(s) instead. This was one of the many things we figured out that we were wrong about and that was incredibly exciting.

Mobile Sharing is Hard
A major feature in the mobile app was the ability to share to elicit donations. We got there but it wasn't easy. Sharing could happen in-app or could be shared to a social media platform. Building a seamless and good looking sharing option is not easy. 

## Design Sprints
One of our most interesting sprints was around reworking our social sharing workflow. As a remote team, traditional Design Sprints presented a specific set of challenges. We had to make some changes to the process to fit our needs:
Define requirements
Group Sketch exercise and critique
Regroup and update requirements as needed
Sketch exercise and critique
Prototype feature for testing
Project handoff for final design/engineering
We did this over the course of around a week. Definitely not the ideal system (Sorry Jake and Daniel) 

## Social Share
One of the issues we wanted to tackle was designing around the issues in sharing for the mobile app. We ran our design sprint around this and came up with some guidelines: 

• Users need to be able to share both to social media and in their timeline inside the App. 

• We needed to design around a framework of extensibility. It's the only way to ensure the ability to add social media platforms when necessary. 

• We have to live with the fact that we're not Instagram. We're going to have to send separate messages from separate form fields.
