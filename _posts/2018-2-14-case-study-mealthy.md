### My time at Mealthy was interesting and challenging. Preemptively building a digital platform to coincide with physical product releases is a very meaty problem set. I'm going to highlight a few specific parts of my 8 months working with the team. I had the opportunity to be an early contract hire which allowed me to grow and lead a very talented team as the organization scaled up.

### Starting from Scratch
As the first contractor for Mealthy I was able to help the CEO define systems and processes to create a product-focused culture. Being the first and only designer for a while meant we were working through a lot of bad ideas. I worked with the CEO to bring in the first engineering contractors to work with the editorial team. We tackled a lot of the crazy early stage work - like branding, defining a basic visual system and helping build and evolve a brand bible.

### Leading and Growing a Team
As our team grew, I found myself taking on more and more responsibility. I was contributing day to day as an IC but more and more I was defining design and front-end coding processes, having 1:1's and reporting back to the CEO. I was overseeing these kinds of high level design details right up to the point that we hired dedicated UX designers to work directly with the CTO and our Business Intelligence Researcher.

### Begin with People
Having former members of the AllRecipes team working with us on Mealthy gave us some insights into general user patterns at scale. Working from there we began testing early versions of the site with UserTesting.com and iterating based on qualitative feedback. As time went on we were able to contour a lot of decisions to the needs and expectations of the people using our products the most.

### Community Features
Mealthy products are built around the joy of eating well and sharing it with others. That sense of community is carried through the products to the digital experiences. An early decision was made that the ability to comment with ratings and saving & sharing recipes were key beta-release features. Because of the engineering logistics, the commenting function came a little later but the business impact of the recipe box and the comments were felt immediately. People were coming back repeatedly to try, rate and comment on recipes. Engagement on the platform increased quickly and was incredibly helpful in pushing sales of physical products.
