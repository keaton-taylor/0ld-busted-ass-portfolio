### A Brief Introduction
Mealthy Recipes is an early stage startup building digital products as well as IoT capable appliances to make the lives of home cooks a little bit easier. Along with a website and native mobile apps, it’s become a highly engaged online community via Facebook Groups.

As the Lead Product Designer for Mealthy I led and grew the product team and was heavily involved in the high-level strategy as well as implementation of nearly every feature in the products through the V1 launch.

Designing a recipe product in an already well-saturated market was not necessarily the easiest or most groundbreaking project I’ve ever worked on but it was really special. We brought in experts from organizations like AllRecipes and Buzzfed Tasty to help us identify our core market and create top-tier branded content.

### The Challenges
I was the first person on board for this project. That in and of itself is definitely a challenge. Seeing a product through from ground floor vision to launch is an exhilarating and often stressful responsibility. Hiring, making recommendations for best-practices and having hard conversations with other designers were all very challenging to me. The prospect of just being another recipe site was a challenge at first. We embraced our ability to overcome market saturation with physical products and tight collaboration with influencers on social media. I'm very proud of the work we did and they continue to do.

### Early Work
In the beginning I was able to help the CEO define systems and processes to create a people-focused culture. Being the first and only product designer for a while meant we were working through a lot of ideas. We tackled a lot of the crazy early stage work - Like defining what the product was and was not going to be, deciding how to structure content, and making hard decisions about monetization.

Ultimately the decisions we landed on included a commitment to an ad-free experience, a focus on Pressure Cooker cooking, and a recipe-driven content strategy (vs an editorial-driven strategy).

Soon after getting rolling I brought in my favorite front-end engineer, who applied his years of startup experience to help the CEO and me define and scope MVP and V1 feature sets and sort them into epics.

For the first month or so of working on Mealthy we didnt have a logo or even a good idea of what or who we were in some ways. Our Editorial Director worked tirelessly to sketch out a living brand bible for us. We worked together to fill in the gaps from the product and engineering side and that helped immensely when it came time to start working on our visual identity.

### Data to the Rescue
Coming into working with our CEO I was adamant that we have a company mandate to be - at the very least - data informed. He agreed to set aside budget and time to allow us to collect and use both qualitative and quantitative data. I wanted to make sure we had a clear picture of what was happening on our platform. Our CEO went one step further and hired a Business Intelligence and Customer Experience Analyst. Having a dedicated team member to run guided usability tests on mock ups and staging servers for our site and app was an immediate game changer. We were able to use that data and some of her recommendations to iterate early-on and avoid potential experience pitfalls. As we shipped the the early staging versions of the site and app her ability to tie qualitative and quantitative data analysis to features we were building and roadmapping was invaluable. With these features in hand and knowing we wanted to have guidestones to work toward, we worked with our CEO, Business Intelligence partner and editorial staff to create a couple of rough personas based on our targeted demographic data, some heavy assumptions and data borrowed from similar properties.

> Kate is a 32 year old stay at home mom of 2. She and her partner live in Des Moines, IA. Their household income is about $83k. Kate's oldest son goes to preschool three days a week while her youngest (21 months) stays at home with her. Kate's a no-nonsense shopper. Frugal and very busy. She's tired of looking at the same recipes night after night and wants the opportunity to cook something easy, but a little different. Kate already uses AllRecipes sometimes but avoids The Kitchn because it's too hard to get to the actual recipes.

> Katherine is a 38 year old professional. She is single and lives in San Luis Obispo, CA. Her Income is around $115k. Katherine has a steady boyfriend and hosts dinner parties at her house every other weekend. Katherine works long hours and tries to meal prep as much as possible to protect her time during the week. She uses google to search for specific recipes and ingredients and doesn't necessarily care what website she finds them in.

### Empowering People
Mealthy products are built around the joy of eating well and sharing it with others. We hoped that sense of community was carried through the products and digital experiences. Working with Business intelligence we did some competitive analysis to see what kind of saving experiences others were using. While some other recipe products at the time had saving there were limitations. Caps on how many items can be saved, a bad UI for those saved recipes and sometimes the saving function flat out didn't work. Knowing those things we set out to build V1 of the best recipe-saving feature on the internet. The business impact of our work on the recipe box section were felt immediately. People were coming back repeatedly to save, share and rate recipes. Engagement on the platform increased quickly and was incredibly helpful in pushing sales of physical products.

### Leading and Growing a Team
As our team grew, I found myself taking on more and more responsibility. I continued contributing day to day as designer but more and more I was defining design and front-end coding processes, having 1:1's and reporting back to the CEO. I was overseeing these kinds of high level details right up to the point that we hired dedicated UX designers to work directly with the CTO and our Business Intelligence Researcher.
